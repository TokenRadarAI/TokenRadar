# TokenRadar

TokenRadar is an AI-powered assistant that helps users discover and analyze new tokens before they trend. It scans Solana and other chains, reads on-chain activity, GitHub commits, social mentions, and wallet behavior. Users get real-time insights on whether a token is safe, trending, or being farmed by whales. Custom alerts, AI-generated summaries, and wallet tagging make it an essential tool for early crypto traders and degen farmers.

## Features

-  **List of Newly Released Tokens**: Automatically fetches a list of recent tokens using CoinGecko API.
-  **Fake Metrics Generator**: Adds mock metrics such as whale activity, developer engagement, and social mentions to simulate in-depth token analytics.
-  **AI-Powered Summary**: Uses Groq + Mixtral API (or OpenAI-compatible) to generate a concise summary of a token's potential.
-  **Interactive Modal UI**: Displays token information in a scrollable modal window that can be closed by clicking outside.
- **Modular and Extensible Codebase**: Built with Next.js 15, React Server Components, and CSS Modules.
